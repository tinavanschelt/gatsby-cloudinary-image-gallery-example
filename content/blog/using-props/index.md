The below gallery is generated by setting the `columns` prop to "3,3,6". Note the use of string and not an array.

```
<photo-gallery folder="old-instagram" columns="3,3,6"></photo-gallery>
```

<photo-gallery folder="old-instagram" columns="3,3,6"></photo-gallery>

The below example is generated by setting the `orientation` prop to "square". Regardless of orientation the gallery always opens up to the actual orientation of the image. Orientation can be either "portrait", "landscape" or "square".

```
<photo-gallery folder="gatsby" orientation="square"></photo-gallery>
```

<photo-gallery folder="gatsby" orientation="square"></photo-gallery>

Here's an example of how the same folder will render without setting the orientation.

```
<photo-gallery folder="gatsby"></photo-gallery>
```

<photo-gallery folder="gatsby"></photo-gallery>
