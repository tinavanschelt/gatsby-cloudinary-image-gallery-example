The below gallery is generated without specifying the `columns` or `orientation` prop, using the following snippet:

```
<photo-gallery folder="gatsby"></photo-gallery>
```

The default behaviour is to render 2 columns when the total image count is an even number and 3 columns when the total image count is an odd number.

<photo-gallery folder="gatsby"></photo-gallery>
